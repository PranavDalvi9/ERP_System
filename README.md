# ERP_System

### I have design an E-Commerce Website named Champ. This project was build as a individual project in Masai School. 

### I have design a ERP system for school/college students, teachers and admin. As the user login, the user can access the data available for a particular user for example the student will able to access only the events and see the detail information of the user login and admin can access all students data and events data, admin can also add events and students to the system.


# Features:-
1. Student can login and access only if student has user-id and password provided by admin.
2. Only Admin can add students to erp system and admin can also add events.
3. Admin can search data of student by name, roll number, contact.
4. Admin can also filter out the data by term and year.


# Technologies that we used :-
1. REACT
2. CSS
3. Node.js
